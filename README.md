**ACM SAC CC**

The  main objective of the project is to automate the process of modification and upgradation of ACM SAC website. The automation process reduces the tedious task of the admin to go through source code every year and modifying it by providing a user interface, where he/she can directly make the required changes without bothering much about the source code.
The process of modifying the website each year can be done by the following steps: 
1) Admin has to login using the admin's user id and password. If the user id and password are valid, the admin will be redirected to theme selection page. If the  admin wants to give the modification rights to some other users, he has to share the user id and password.
2)  In the theme selection page, three themes will be displayed from which the admin has to choose the theme of his choice. After selection, the previous year's website will be displayed with the theme selected by the admin. Here, the admin can make the required modifications to create the upcoming year's website.
3) For all the attributes that may require modification every year, a 'change' button will be displayed beside it. If the admin wishes to change a particular attribute, he has to click on the corresponding 'change' button and make the necessary modifications.
4) A 'Submit' button will be displayed at the end of the webpage. After making all the required modifications, the admin has to click on the 'Submit' button to launch a new website for the upcoming year.
